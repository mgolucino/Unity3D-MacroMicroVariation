The **Macro / Micro Variation** shader is an Amplify shader made to reduce the visibility of texture tiling on very large objects. This shader does not actually remove the tiling in your textures; however, it can hide it to a degree by introducing randomness to the base color of your object.

# Instructions
Download the **Macro Micro Variation** folder in this repository and import it into your Unity 3D project. Create a new material and use **Macro Micro Variation** as the shader. Assign textures and values to the material like any other PBR material, then assign a texture for **Variation Texture**, which will be overlayed on top of the albedo texture. This texture will be sampled three times at different scales according to the x, y, and z values of the **Variation Scale** property. Then, adjust the intensity of the overlay by using the **Variation Strength** property. Refer to the demo scene for sample material setups.
